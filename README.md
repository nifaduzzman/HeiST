Student Self-Dependency Platform
Introduction
The Student Self-Dependency Platform is a web and mobile application designed to connect students (ages 16-17 and above) with part-time job opportunities. The platform aims to help students in Bangladesh become financially independent by offering them flexible job opportunities while they study. This system allows employers to post part-time or short-term job opportunities, and students can apply based on their skills and interests.

Problem Statement
In many countries, students work part-time to support their education and daily expenses. However, in Bangladesh, there is a gap between students seeking part-time jobs and employers looking for flexible labor. This platform bridges that gap by allowing students to earn while studying, promoting financial independence.

Features
Two User Groups:

Students: Can create profiles, list their skills, and apply for jobs.
Employers: Can post job listings, view student profiles, and hire them for part-time work.
Job Listings: A searchable board where employers can post part-time job opportunities for students.

Profile Management: Both students and employers can create and manage their profiles.

Search & Filter: Students can search for jobs based on location, job type, and required skills.

Messaging: A basic communication system for students and employers to discuss job details.
